**As an incoming freshman trying to major in Engineering, what courses should I be taking?**

It is highly recommended that you are enrolled in three courses, including Computer Programming for Engineers, a Math Course, and FYWS or Core Colloquium. This will prevent you from falling behind. Students currently enrolled in only two courses (underloading), or are not enrolled in the suggested courses, should revise their schedules. 

**What is MATH-UH 1000 A&B? Is it one semester or two semesters? How does it work?**

The MATH-UH 1000 A&B is a new course set up by the Math department. It replaces the previously available set of pre-calculus courses (Vectors, Functions, Trigonometry). Each “section” (A&B) are 2-credits and are meant to be completed in the same semester. The course is also meant to be completed prior to enrolling in Calculus.

**I placed into MATH-UH 1000 A&B, but I do not feel like this placement accurately reflects my math level. What can I do about this?**

It is possible to try to appeal your case to the Maths Department, provided you have legitimate reasoning. However, there is no guarantee that your math level will be changed. It is entirely up to the discretion of the Maths Department. 

**I placed into MATH-UH 1000 A&B. Will it affect my graduation time?**

Yes it will impact your graduation year, you will now be graduating in 9-10 semesters. Once the bulletin is released we will be able to show how/why this is the case.  \

Keep in mind, neither the Engineering Department nor the Engineering Academic Committee recommend this pathway. We are unable to say whether the student will be able to receive financial support for their extra semester(s) as this is not a decision we are involved in.

**I placed into MATH-UH 1000 A&B. Will this affect my study-aways or J-terms?**

You will still be able to study away for a semester. Once the bulletin is released we will be able to show when this study-away would take place. You should still have the same number of J-term courses (3).

Keep in mind, neither dsd the Engineering Department nor the Engineering Academic Committee recommend this pathway. We are unable to say whether the student will be able to receive financial support for their extra semester(s) as this is not a decision we are involved in.

**I want to major in Engineering but may also switch into X. What courses should I do?** \
 \
That’s a really difficult question to answer because there it depends on how likely you are, how you feel after taking the introductory courses, and what you placed into.  \
 \
However, when making your decision, do keep in mind that all Natural Science and Engineering courses will require you to do FOS. Also, keep in mind that if you achieve an A- or above in Computer Programming for Engineers, this can transfer over to credits for Introduction to Computer Science. Also, keep in mind that you can complete an Engineering minor if you start FOS but switch majors later.

**Since FOS 3/4 are no longer required, what are the other courses that we should take in order to replace the science courses requirement?**

The extension of certain math courses (e.g. Linear Algebra, ODE, etc) covers your math/science ABET requirements. You don’t have to worry about this. 

For those opting out of FOS 3/4 , you must do either Quantitative Synthetic Biology or Electromagnetics (for Engineers?) course.

Keep in mind that for those wishing to major in Bioengineering, FOS 1-6 will still be required.

**Is it possible to do a minor in Aerospace engineering?**

Incoming students should NOT plan on pursuing an aerospace minor. This is due to changing demands and course availability. Current students, if you are able to complete your requirements for the minor through the NYU New York course this fall, please take advantage of this.

**I want to major in Bioengineering and would love to receive any updates regarding the major. Where do I find this information?**

Once the bulletin is released, we will have an information page dedicated to the Bioengineering major! It will outline the Bioengineering pathway, courses, and answer from frequently asked questions. Also, if you’re looking for something very specific, you’re always welcome to reach out to Ansen(Bioengineering rep) at [zhl232@nyu.edu](mailto:zhl232@nyu.edu) for more info.

You can assume that as an incoming freshman you will have the option to major in Bioengineering as it has been approved.

**What are the categories we will be evaluated on in order to have 2 study away semesters?**

This is an evolving situation with details still being worked out. As decisions are made, we will let you know. For now, the best thing you can do is do well academically.

Keep in mind that historically only a small group of students have had the opportunity for two study away semesters. 

**In the sample schedule for computer engineering, there is a course named Computer Systems Programming. What is this, I can’t find it anywhere else?**

This refers to Object-Oriented Programming. The course was renamed but you may find older sources that still carry this previous name.
